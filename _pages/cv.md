Education
======
* B.S. in Earth Science and Mathematics, Columbia University (2024)

Work experience
======
* Battelle- Geology Intern (May 2023-March 2024)
  * Processed and quality controlled well records from state surveys in the MRCI region using R and SQL, creating a centralized database of 100,000+ wells and regional maps of well data in ArcGIS for scoping future carbon storage sites.
  * Analyzed data on geophysical monitoring plans, insurance mechanisms, and regulatory involvement for carbon storage project permits and visualized results using R and Power BI.
  * Interpreted and integrated well log and core data from 25 wells alongside data from literature review to construct a 3D static earth model of potential carbon storage site in the Mt Simon Sandstone in Indiana using Petrel.
  * Analyzed and visualized historical emissions data by sector in the Midwest region using R and ArcGIS, making recommendations for the applicability of carbon capture and storage in the region
  * 
* Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering at Columbia University- Undergraduate Researcher (August 2022-May 2024)
  * Worked on a project assessing the effect of formation water pH on carbon mineralization in basalt reservoirs and effects on permeability using geochemical software PHREEQC and reactive transport modeling. Presented work at AGU2023.
  * Modeled in situ recovery of critical minerals from hard rock deposits using geochemical and reactive transport modeling.
  * Investigated the viability of using pre/post injection well logs from the Wallula Basalt mineralisation project to determine carbon mineralisation extent and changes in rock properties in collaboration with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
  * Created workflow for fabricating synthetic rock cores from soda lime glass beads for experimental use, controlling fabrication parameters for petrophysical properties. Imaged and analyzed cores using optical microscope and microCT scans. Presented work at Interpore 2023.

* Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory/NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, New York, NY- Undergraduate Researcher/Climate Change Research Intern (January 2022-August 2022)
  * Participated in NASAâ€™s Climate Change Research Initiative working with Dr. Dorothy Peteet investigating the potential effects of sea level rise on carbon stocks in Eastern US coastal salt marshes. Work was presented at AGU 2022.
  * Created methodology for modeling marsh depth and volume using ArcGIS Pro, analyzed and processed marsh spatial data in Python, and cleaned and filtered marsh databases in R.
  * Designed tools to assist with probing and measuring marsh depth. Performed probing transects to collect depth data on several marshes in New York.
